# irmaandroid Demo App

This is demonstration app showing how to use `irmaandroid` to send an IRMA session to the IRMA mobile app.

## Usage

This app depends on the `demoserver` server. It needs to be started using an IP address that will be reachable for the device running the app. When using the android emulator, 10.0.2.2 works. Then, this folder can be opened as project in Android Studio and run on an Android device using that. When running the server on a different IP-address, you will need to modify the app to connect to it.
